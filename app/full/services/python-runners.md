# Python Runners

Sim4Life features Python, a powerful scientific scripting language offering a vast range of 3rd-party programs. The Sim4Life Python application programming interface (API) can be used to parameterize and automatize tasks, e.g., geometric modeling, simulation setup, or postprocessing, and to build custom tools and independent applications.

Sim4Life Python Runners are powerful solvers designed to operate in high-performance computing environments, enabling robust backend computation. These runners execute any Python code, including scripts that make use of the comprehensive Sim4Life Python API. Additional libraries can be seamlessly installed via requirements files, enhancing functionality as needed. Furthermore, multiple runners can be interconnected or integrated with other services, allowing for the creation of sophisticated computational pipelines tailored to complex workflows.
