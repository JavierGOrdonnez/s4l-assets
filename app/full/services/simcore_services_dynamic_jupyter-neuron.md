[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) with **math** kernels in [GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/index) (largely compatible with MATLAB code) and Python, with a special emphasis on neural modeling and simulation. 
Python kernel includes the following neuro-related packages:
- [NEURON](https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/)
- [NEST](https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ref_material/pynest_apis.html)
- [TVB](https://pypi.org/project/tvb/)
- [PyNN](https://neuralensemble.org/PyNN/)
- [BluePyOpt](https://github.com/BlueBrain/BluePyOpt#readme)
- [Brian2](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 
- [brian2tools](https://pypi.org/project/brian2tools/)
- [NetPyNE](http://netpyne.org/)
- [pyNeuroML](https://docs.neuroml.org/Userdocs/Software/pyNeuroML.html)

This service also provides analysis and visualization packages including [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/),
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) and
[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) packages (see [requirements.in](https://github.com/ITISFoundation/jupyter-neuron/blob/main/kernels/python-neuron/requirements.in)).

- Interface: interactive notebook with an IPython kernel
- Best for: interactive model building, parameter sweeps, optimization
- Outputs: .ipynb notebooks, figures, PDF/CSV files etc.
