# Sim4Life Framework

Sim4Life Framework is Sim4Life without the built-in simulation solvers. It provides all the familiar pre- and post-processing tools from Sim4Life—CAD modeling, mesh generation, visualization, Virtual Population integration, and analysis capabilities—but removes the computational solvers.

## Key Difference
Instead of built-in solvers, the Framework uses a plugin architecture that allows for the installation and integration of third-party simulation solvers. This provides the flexibility to build a customized simulation environment tailored to specific requirements.

## What's Included

- Complete Sim4Life pre/post-processing toolkit
- CAD modeling and mesh generation tools
- Advanced visualization and analysis capabilities
- Virtual Population and medical imaging tools
- Plugin Manager for third-party solver integration

## What's Not Included

- Built-in electromagnetic, thermal, or other physics solvers
- Ready-to-run simulation capabilities (requires solver plugins)

The Framework is ideal for users who want Sim4Life's powerful modeling and analysis environment but prefer to use their own simulation solvers or need specialized computational capabilities not available in the standard Sim4Life package.
