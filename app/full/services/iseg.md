# iSEG

The Medical Image Segmentation Tool Set (iSEG) is a segmentation toolbox for the efficient, fast, and flexible generation (including pre- and postprocessing) of anatomical models from various types of imaging data. A wide selection of segmentation methods, including competitive region growing approaches, fuzzy connectedness analysis, level-set methods, topologically flexible interpolation, and dedicated vasculature segmentation, ensures the efficient and flexible generation of surface models.

iSEG features a unique set of flexibly combinable automatic, semi-automatic, and interactive segmentation algorithms. Novel algorithms based on competitive segmentation methods, for example, optimize the generation of models with many different tissues. Anatomical reference atlases are also available.

iSEG is capable of handling a variety of image data (e.g., it is compatible with all standard CT and MRI image formats) and large-scale models.

iSEG offers unique possibilities for medical diagnosis/treatment and basic research applications, e.g., for personalized modeling and treatment planning or to investigate physical and physiological processes in realistic anatomical environments.
