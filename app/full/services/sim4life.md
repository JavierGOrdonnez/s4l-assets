# Sim4Life

Sim4Life is a simulation platform developed for the design of antennas, wireless devices, wearable devices, and medical implants and the assessment of device interaction with human anatomy. The platform enables the prediction of multifaceted and dynamic physiological responses that allow the evaluation of treatments' efficacy and safety. Sim4Life  integrates the Virtual Population human phantoms and the Virtual Zoo animal phantoms - the gold standard of computable phantoms that include poser and morphing tools for comprehensive population coverage. 

Sim4Life includes modules for MRI coil design and sequence design and optimization for MRI safety of patients with implanted active and/or passive medical devices, as well as for converting MRI and CT image data into personalized high-resolution multi-tissue models via manual and AI-supported segmentation techniques that include assignment of tissue properties. 

Other modules support the evaluation of wireless communication and power transfer, including charging implanted medical devices and the investigation of neural stimulation applications, including transcranial electric and magnetic stimulation, transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation, neuroprosthetics, and electroceuticals. 

Precision medical applications include optimization of radiofrequency and microwave ablation therapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound, and hyperthermia for cancer treatment, as well as analysis of vascular flow and biofluidics for stent design and optimization. 

The platform also includes access to the IMAnalytics and the IT'IS MRIxViP1.5T/3.0T field libraries of the US FDA-approved Medical Device Development Tool.
