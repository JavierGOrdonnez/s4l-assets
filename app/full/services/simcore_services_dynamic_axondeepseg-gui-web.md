AxonDeepSeg is an open-source software using deep learning and aiming at automatically segmenting axons and myelin sheaths from microscopy images. It performs 3-class semantic segmentation using a convolutional neural network. AxonDeepSeg was developed at NeuroPoly Lab, Polytechnique Montreal, University of Montreal, Canada. See the [GitHub](https://github.com/axondeepseg/axondeepseg/) respository and [documentation](https://axondeepseg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for more information.

AxonDeepSeg GUI is a fully-interactive wrapper around AxonDeepSegâ€™s napari plug-in, letting users launch *ads_napari*, visualize microscopy stacks, run CNN-based axon/-myelin segmentation, and hand-correct results directly in the browser notebook window.
