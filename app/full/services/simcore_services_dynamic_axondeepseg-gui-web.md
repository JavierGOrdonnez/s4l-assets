AxonDeepSeg is an open-source software using deep learning and aiming at automatically 
segmenting axons and myelin sheaths from microscopy images. 
It performs 3-class semantic segmentation using a convolutional neural network. <br>
AxonDeepSeg was developed at NeuroPoly Lab, Polytechnique Montreal, University of Montreal, Canada.
