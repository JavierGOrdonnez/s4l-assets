# iSolve

Sim4Life is the first computational life sciences platform to integrate computable human phantoms with the most powerful physics solvers and the most advanced tissue models for direct analysis of biological real-world phenomena and complex technical devices in a 3D validated biological and anatomical environment. 

iSolve service provides access to Sim4Life's optimized, high-performance solvers which tackle a range of problems from electromagnetics and thermodynamics with perfusion to sound propagation and fluid dynamics. Sim4Life offers high-performance parallel computing, visualization, and postprocessing and ensures interoperability among the solvers. Moreover, the coupling framework is customizable and extendable through additional solvers.

Physics solvers:
 - Electromagnetics Full Wave Solvers
 - Quasi-Static Electromagnetic Solvers
 - Bioheat & Thermodynamics Solvers
 - Acoustics & Wave Propagation Solvers
 - Fluid Dynamics Solvers
