# Jupyterlab

Sim4Life features Python, a powerful scientific scripting language offering a vast range of 3rd-party programs. The Sim4Life Python application programming interface (API) can be used to parameterize and automatize tasks, e.g., geometric modeling, simulation setup, or postprocessing, and to build custom tools and independent applications.

JupyterLab is a highly extensible, feature-rich notebook authoring application and editing environment. It is a part of Project Jupyter, a large umbrella project centered around the goal of providing tools (and standards) for interactive computing with computational notebooks. 

A computational notebook is a shareable document that combines computer code, plain language descriptions, data, rich visualizations like 3D models, charts, graphs and figures, and interactive controls. A notebook, along with an editor like JupyterLab, provides a fast interactive environment for prototyping and explaining code, exploring and visualizing data, and sharing ideas with others.
